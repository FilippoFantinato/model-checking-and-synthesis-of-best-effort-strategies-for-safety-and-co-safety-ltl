% This is the acknowledgments section.

The first thank and my deepest gratitude go to Professor Davide Bresolin and Doctor Stefano Tonetta for meticulousness during the writing of this thesis and for the careful attention payed since the first initial phases of this work.

Moreover, I want to thank you again Stefano Tonetta and all people of the Formal Methods for Systems and Software Design unit for welcoming me to Fondazione Bruno Kessler and making me feel part of their big family.

A heartfelt thanks goes to all my family, in particular to my parents, Alessandra Galassi and Roberto Fantinato, and my sister, Sara Fantinato, for always supporting me and pushing me to never give up.
Last but not least, I want to thank my girlfriend Alice Gasparini for always being by my side and helping me through the hardest times.

These years have been a very important part of my life that I end with sadness, but also with a smile. I thank Alessandro, Cristiano, Damiano, Daniel, Davide, Diletta, Luca, Massimiliano, Nicol√≤ and Saadat for having made the university a unique place between laughs in LabTA and lunches at the Piovego canteen.

% To quote the book "Slaughterhouse-Five" by Kurt Vonnegut: "if I have to spend eternity visiting now this and now that moment I am grateful that so many of these moments are beautiful".
I will always keep in my heart all people who have been close to me in these two years and, regardless of the paths we take, they will always be part of an important and unforgettable piece of my life.
